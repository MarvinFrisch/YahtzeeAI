# YahtzeeAI
An approach to make the machine learn yahtzee

Uses a genetic algorithm to adapt the weights of a neural network getting the dice and the still available spaces on the scorecard as input and returning the dice to be rerolled and the score field as output

Current scores a bit lackluster
